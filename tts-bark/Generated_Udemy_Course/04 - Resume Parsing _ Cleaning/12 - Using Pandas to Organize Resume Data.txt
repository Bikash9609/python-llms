Here's the voiceover script for using Pandas to organize resume data:

Let's use Pandas to organize our resume data.

First, let's import the Pandas library:
`
import pandas as pd
`
Next, let's create a Pandas DataFrame from our resume data:
`
resume_data = {"Name": ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"], 
                "Age": [30, 25], 
                "Skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "HTML/CSS"], 
                "Experience": ["Software Engineer", "Web Developer"]}
df = pd.DataFrame(resume_data)
`
This DataFrame has four columns: Name, Age, Skills, and Experience.

Now let's use Pandas to manipulate our data. For example, let's sort our resume data by age:
`
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by="Age")
print(sorted_df)
`
This will print out our resume data in the order of ascending age.

We can also use Pandas to filter our data based on specific criteria. For example, let's find all resumes with Python as a skill:
`
python_skill_df = df[df["Skills"].str.contains("Python")]
print(python_skill_df)
`
This will print out all resumes that have Python as one of their skills.

Finally, let's use Pandas to group our data by specific criteria. For example, let's group our resume data by age and then find the average number of skills per person:
`
grouped_df = df.groupby("Age")["Skills"].count().mean()
print(grouped_df)
`
This will print out the average number of skills per person for each age group.

That's it! Now you can use Pandas to organize, manipulate, and analyze your resume data.
