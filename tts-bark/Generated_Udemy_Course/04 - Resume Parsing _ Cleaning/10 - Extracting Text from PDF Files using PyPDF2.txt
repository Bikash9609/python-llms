Here's the voiceover script for extracting text from PDF files using PyPDF2:

Let's extract the text from PDF files using PyPDF2.

First, let's install PyPDF2:
`
pip install PyPDF2
`
Now that we have PyPDF2 installed, let's open a new Python file and import it:
`
import PyPDF2

# Open a PDF file in read-binary mode
pdf_file = open("resume.pdf", "rb")

# Create a PDF file reader object
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)

# Get the number of pages in the PDF file
num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages

for page_num in range(num_pages):
    # Read the text from each page
    page_obj = pdf_reader.getPage(page_num)
    page_text = page_obj.extractText()

    # Print the extracted text
    print(page_text)

# Close the PDF file
pdf_file.close()
`
Here's what we're doing:

* We import PyPDF2 and open a PDF file in read-binary mode.
* We create a PDF file reader object and get the number of pages in the PDF file.
* We loop through each page, reading the text using extractText().
* Finally, we print the extracted text.

That's it! Now you can extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2.
