Here's the voiceover script for fastapi project setup and basic routing:

Let's set up our FastAPI project and create some basic routes.

First, let's install FastAPI using pip:
`
pip install fastapi
`
Now, let's create a new directory for our project and navigate into it. Then, we'll initialize a new Python package:
`
mkdir resume_analyzer
cd resume_analyzer
python -m pip init --name resume_analyzer
`
Next, let's add FastAPI to our project:
`
pip install fastapi[all]
`
Now that we have FastAPI installed, let's create a new file called main.py and define our first route:
`
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Resume Analyzer API!"}
`
Here's what we're doing:

* We import FastAPI and create a new instance of it.
* We define a GET route for the root URL ("/") that returns a JSON response with a message.

That's it! We've set up our first FastAPI project and created a basic route. In the next lesson, we'll learn how to handle form data and file uploads in our API.
