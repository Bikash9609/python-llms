Here's the voiceover script for setting up Python, Node.js, and VS Code:

Let's get started by setting up our development environment. This will be a crucial step in building our smart resume analyzer and job matcher. We'll need to install Node.js, Python, Conda, Git, and VS Code.

First, open VS Code and create a new folder called 'resume-analyzer'. Now open the integrated terminal and type:

npm init vite@latest frontend -- --template react

This creates our React frontend using Vite. The --template react flag specifies we want a React project, which will give us a solid foundation for building our UI.

Next, let's install Python if you haven't already. You can download the latest version from the official Python website. Once installed, open your terminal and type:

python -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

These libraries are essential for web scraping and parsing in our Python backend. The requests library allows us to send HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup helps us parse HTML documents, and Pandas enables data manipulation and analysis.

Now let's set up Conda if you haven't already. This is a package manager specifically designed for data science and scientific computing. You can download the latest version from the official Conda website. Once installed, open your terminal and type:

conda create -n resume-analyzer python=3.9

This creates a new environment called 'resume-analyzer' with Python 3.9 as our default interpreter.

Finally, let's install Git if you haven't already. This is a version control system that allows us to track changes in our codebase. You can download the latest version from the official Git website. Once installed, open your terminal and type:

git init

This initializes a new Git repository in our project directory.

That's it for now! In the next lesson, we'll start building our React frontend using Create React App and Tailwind CSS. See you then!
