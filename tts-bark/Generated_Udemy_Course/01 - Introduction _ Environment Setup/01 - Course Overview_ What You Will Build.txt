Here's the voiceover script for the coding tutorial video:

Let's start by setting the stage for our project. We're going to build a smart resume analyzer and job matcher using React, Python, and OpenAI. This is an all-open-source course designed specifically for complete beginners.

Now we'll get started with the environment setup. First, you need to install Node.js if you haven't already. Once installed, open VS Code and create a new folder called 'resume-analyzer'. Then, open the integrated terminal and type:

npm init vite@latest frontend -- --template react

This creates our React frontend using Vite. The --template react flag specifies we want a React project, which will give us a solid foundation for building our UI.

Now let's install some dependencies. We'll need Tailwind CSS to style our components. Run the following command:

npm install tailwindcss

Important to note that we're not setting up any complex build tools or configurations. Vite takes care of everything for us, allowing us to focus on writing code.

Next, create a new file called app.js and add the following code:

import { createSignal } from 'react';
import './styles.css';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = createSignal('');
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Welcome to Resume Analyzer!</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Why we do this: We're creating a basic React app with a single input field. This will serve as the foundation for our resume uploader and manager.

That's it for now. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into building our UI using Tailwind CSS. See you then!
