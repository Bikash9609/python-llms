Here's the voiceover script for installing Git, creating a GitHub repo, and project structure overview:

Let's start by setting up our version control system with Git. This will help us manage changes in our codebase as we build our smart resume analyzer and job matcher.

First, open your terminal and type:

git init

This initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. Now let's create a GitHub repo to store our project files online. Go to the GitHub website, log in or sign up if you haven't already, then create a new repository called 'resume-analyzer'.

Now that we have our project structure set up, let's take a look at what it should contain. Our root directory will hold all the files for our React frontend and Python backend. We'll also have a data directory to store any CSV or JSON files used in our project.

Here's how your file structure should look like:

* resume-analyzer/
  * frontend/
    * app.js
    * components/
      * ResumeUploader.js
      * JobMatcher.js
    * styles.css
  * backend/
    * app.py
    * models/
      * __init__.py
      * Resume.py
      * Job.py
  * data/
    * resumes.csv
    * jobs.json

That's it for now! In the next lesson, we'll start building our React frontend using Create React App and Tailwind CSS. See you then!
