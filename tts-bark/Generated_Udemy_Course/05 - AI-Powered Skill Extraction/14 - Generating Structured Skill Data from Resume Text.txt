Here's the voiceover script for generating structured skill data from resume text:

Let's take our unstructured resume text and turn it into a structured skill dataset that we can use for machine learning.

First, let's import the necessary libraries:
`
import pandas as pd
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
`
This code imports Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for tokenization, and scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer for converting text into numerical features.

Now let's load our resume text into a Pandas DataFrame:
`
resume_data = pd.read_csv("resumes.csv")
print(resume_data.head())
`
This code loads the resume text from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, and then prints out the first few rows to verify that everything is working as expected.

Next, let's tokenize our resume text using NLTK:
`
tokenized_text = []
for row in resume_data.itertuples():
    text = " ".join(word_tokenize(row.text))
    tokenized_text.append(text)
`
This code iterates through each row of the DataFrame, tokenizes the text using NLTK, and then appends the tokenized text to a list.

Now let's convert our tokenized text into numerical features using scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer:
`
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(tokenized_text)
print(tfidf_matrix.shape)
`
This code creates a TF-IDF vectorizer, fits it to the tokenized text, and then converts the text into a numerical matrix.

Finally, let's save our structured skill dataset as a CSV file:
`
pd.DataFrame(tfidf_matrix.toarray()).to_csv("skills.csv", index=False, header=None)
`
This code saves the TF-IDF matrix as a CSV file, with each row representing a resume and each column representing a word in the vocabulary.

That's it! Now you have a structured skill dataset that you can use for machine learning.
