Here's the voiceover script for building the resume upload UI:

Let's start building our resume upload UI in React. We'll create a simple form with an input field for uploading resumes.

Open your App.js file and type:
`
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [resumeFile, setResumeFile] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Resume Analyzer</h1>
      <form>
        <input
          type="file"
          accept=".pdf, .docx, .txt"
          onChange={(event) => setResumeFile(event.target.files[0])}
        />
        {resumeFile && <p>Selected file: {resumeFile.name}</p>}
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
`
Here's what we're doing:

* We import React and the useState hook to manage our form state.
* We create a ResumeFile state variable to store the selected resume file.
* We render a simple form with an input field for uploading resumes. The accept attribute specifies the allowed file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
* We use the onChange event handler to update our resumeFile state variable when a file is selected.

That's it! Now we have a basic resume upload UI in place. In the next lesson, we'll learn how to handle file uploads and process the uploaded resumes.
