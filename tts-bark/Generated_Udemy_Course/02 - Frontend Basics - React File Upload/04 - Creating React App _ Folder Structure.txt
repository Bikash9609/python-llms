Here's the voiceover script for creating React app & folder structure:

Let's create our React app using Create React App. This will give us a solid foundation for building our frontend.

Open your terminal and type:

npx create-react-app resume-analyzer --template react

This creates our React app with all the necessary files and folders. Now let's take a look at the folder structure. We have a resume-analyzer directory, which contains our React app files.

Here's how your file structure should look like:

* resume-analyzer/
  * node_modules/
    * ...
  * public/
    * favicon.ico
    * index.html
    * logo192.png
    * manifest.json
    * robots.txt
  * src/
    * App.js
    * App.test.js
    * index.js
    * serviceWorker.js
    * setupTests.js

Important to note that the public folder contains our static assets, such as images and HTML files. The src folder contains our React app code.

Why we do this: By using Create React App, we can focus on writing code without worrying about setting up a project from scratch. This will save us time and reduce the complexity of our development environment.

That's it for now! In the next lesson, we'll start building our React frontend by creating a file uploader component. See you then!
